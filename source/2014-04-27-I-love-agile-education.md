title: I Love Agile Education

I come from a background of education that is well-defined and clean-cut. Although lots of professors would argue that
engineering is a profession that is not at all cookie-cutter, the way that I was educated did not leave much wiggle-room for
creative problem solving. There was generally one way to solve the problem and the answer was either right or wrong.
It was very black and white. I also come from a working background where agility was what I exhibited when I was crawling
around in the back of a van loading and unloading dental equipment. Needless to say, the agile education I have been
receiving at gSchool has been a completely unique learning experience.

For me, studying engineering was four years of feeling behind and while feeling like most everyone else was
caught up. I didn't help myself out the first year by nailing down the basics, and comments from professors in classes after
the first year like: 'if you don't know this by now, you probably shouldn't be here' did not help me want to learn or ask
questions for fear of being exposed. I did a lot of squeaking by. At the time, I thought that I was one of the only ones
who was in a boat behind everyone else, but looking back now, when test averages were consistently
in the 60-70% range, I realize that many of my fellow students must have been in the same boat. Math and science material
is hard to learn and hard to teach. Especially when students are not encouraged to ask questions. I realize that part
of my issue stems from my quieter personality and on some level my pride, and I also realize that there are tons of
resources available for students who are struggling that are frequently not utilized. That being said, I never felt
particularly encouraged to utilize the resources available to me and didn't really have a good feel for what they were even.

There has been a lot of talk recently about higher education and the benefits of students doing higher-ed versus the increasing
cost of attending a university. I have read numerous articles about how students studying the arts do
not have very high job prospects upon graduation, and are statistically worse-off financially than if had they not gone
to college at all. While I value fine arts and think that they are crucial to the whole of society, I think it is worth
students thinking twice before studying the arts without developing other, more tangible skills. Students
are terribly unprepared to make the huge financial decision involved in going into college. Also, many students do not
have a clear picture of what they want to do. If I had taken a year off before college, and spent that time deciding what
profession I wanted to go into, I think I would have been much more focused and motivated to learn.

It seems like universities have become behemoths that have gotten comfortable and aren't doing what they
were meant to. I have learned more from attending gSchool for 8 weeks than I learned in 4 years at a university. A big
reason for our incredible learning pace is that our education is tailored to our class of 26. Which seems to work
surprisingly well. We sit down every other week for an hour to talk about what went well over the past two weeks and what
didn't. Our instructors work incredibly hard to make sure that we have the study materials and face time that we need
to get our questions answered. We are frequently told to ask questions. Reading Kent Beck's book, _Extreme Programming
Explained_, before class started really helped to set the tone. I will get off my soapbox for today, but my advice to anyone
is this: if you have a choice between traditional education and agile education, choose agile. You will learn so much more.
