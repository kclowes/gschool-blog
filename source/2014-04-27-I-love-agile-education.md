title: I Love Agile Education

I come from a background of education that did not leave much room for deviating from the textbook. Although lots of professors would argue that
engineering is a profession that is not at all cookie-cutter, the way that I was educated did not leave much wiggle-room for
creative problem solving. Generally, we followed one text and there was one way to solve the problems. The answer
was either right or wrong. I also come from a working background where agility was what I exhibited when I was crawling
around in the back of a van loading and unloading dental equipment. Needless to say, the agile education I have been
receiving at gSchool has been a completely unique learning experience.

My undergraduate experience felt like our professors were just checking off boxes to get everything covered, regardless of
how deep our understanding was or wasn't. I'm sure some of that has to do with the bureaucracy of running a university, but
for an organization (a big organization!) that is about learning, it doesn't seem like it's the most effective method.
There has been a lot of talk recently about the future of higher education, so it will be interesting to watch what happens there.

All I know is that I have learned a truly incredible amount from attending gSchool for the past 8 weeks. A big
reason for our incredible learning pace is that our education is tailored to our class of 26. We have affectionately coined
the term 'agile education'. Agile education actually seems to work surprisingly well with our big-ish group. We sit down
every other week for an hour to talk about what went well over the past two weeks and what could be better. And then things
actually change. Our instructors work incredibly hard to make sure that we have the study materials
and face time that we need to get our questions answered. We are frequently told to ask questions. Reading Kent Beck's book,
_Extreme Programming Explained_, before class started really helped to set the tone for us going in.
My advice to anyone is this: if you have a choice between traditional education and agile education, choose agile.
You will learn so much more.
