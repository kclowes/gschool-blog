title: A Softer Post- This week in gSchool

This week in gSchool we were working on a URL shortener, similar to bit.ly. We paired for a lot
of hours on it at the end of last week and the beginning of this one. I am perhaps inordinately proud of the site that
we built. That site can be seen here: http://desolate-plains-6329.herokuapp.com/. (Thank you very much, Paul Wenig and
Peggy Griffin for all of your help--wouldn't have been possible without you!) It works almost like a URL shortener except
that generally it makes the URL longer. If you copy and paste the new URL that is generated though, you will be redirected
to the site that you originally put in. I know it does not seem very impressive, but it is nice to be able to show
something for our work. It is still a work in progress and I hope to continue working on it some this week.

We jumped into learning about databases on Wednesday. I am not sure why, but I am liking databases a lot. They just make
sense and the commands that they respond to are just like plain English. People say that is what Ruby is like too, but
maybe databases are just simpler creatures. I am looking forward to learning more about them.

I am slowly learning that our instructor feedback is invaluable to our education. If you are a beginner, have someone
look over your work and if they give you good feedback (as in, the constructive sort) treasure it like gold. I got feedback
just today about something that I would have never thought about had I been on my own. I am also slowly learning when to ask
 for help. When I get stuck on something, one wise instructor told me that I have to ask after I have beat my head against
 the desk for 15 minutes. Though I usually do wait more than 15 minutes before I ask for help (something I am working on),
 I know that if I start to get extremely frustrated I need to ask someone. I also have found that when I don't even know where
 to start looking, that is a good time to ask. As a beginner, StackOverflow is not usually the best option.
Anyway, if you are a beginner, I HIGHLY recommend having someone who is a mentor-type figure for you, that you can ask questions
of. I cannot imagine if I was doing this on my own. I am pretty sure I would have given up by now if I didn't have such awesome
people around me.

I have learned more in the past 5 weeks about both coding and myself than I have in the past two years. And that is really,
really fun. I will leave you with a paraphrased quote from one of my mentors: "If you like using your brain, you will like coding".
 So if you like using your brain, coding is probably for you and I encourage you to keep on keeping on!
