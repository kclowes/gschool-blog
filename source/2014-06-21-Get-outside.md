title: Get Outside!

All right, it has been quite a while since I last posted. Demo days, sister graduating, and some amount of prioritizing other things
have kept me from writing.
So, I will keep it short today. We are on our gSchool 'spring break' and my advice to everyone is: get outside! There are so many
good reasons to do so, but in short, being outside lifts your spirits and reminds you that there are bigger things out there than your
failing test (or passing test for that matter). Especially when you are lucky enough to live and play in the Rockies,
that reminder becomes way more clear.

The past few weeks (months) have been a whirlwind, but it is nice to have some time to relax and hang out. Step away from your computer
and refresh. Just for a few minutes. You won't be sad you did!
