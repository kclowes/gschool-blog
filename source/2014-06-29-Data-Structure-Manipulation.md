title: A Little Sunday Afternoon Data Structure Manipulation

A common theme recently, in both our class warm-ups and in doing Exercism exercises has been reading things from a CSV, 
and then storing the data in a sorted hash or array. So I thought I would solidify it a little bit by posting here. As a 
side note, one thing that I have been reminded of time and time again is to make things very small and then you can 
extrapolate from there. For me, starting small and building helps to conceptualize what I am doing and not get 
overwhelmed over-complicating things. Anyway, let's get started. 
 
We will assume the data came from a CSV and we know how to read it using the CSV class. The CSV docs can be found 
[here](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html)
if you want to reference them. Here are a few lines of the initial CSV file:

```
Person,Week,Day,Mode,Inbound,Outbound,Distance
Emily,4,Monday,Walk,12,15,0.65
Gerard,1,Wednesday,Drive,14,12,5
Emily,5,Tuesday,Walk,12,15,0.65
```

Reading the file by row using the CSV method will result in an array of arrays as shown below: 

```
[['Emily', 4 ,'Monday', 'Walk', 12, 15, 0.65],
['Gerard', 1, 'Wednesday', 'Drive', 14, 12,5],
['Emily', 5, 'Tuesday', 'Walk', 12, 15, 0.65]]
```

Let's first start by sorting by the name. This is what our end product will look like: 

```
     {
     "Emily" => [
        {
          week: 4,
          day: "Monday",
          mode: "Walk",
          inbound: 12,
          outbound: 15,
          distance: 0.65
        },
        {
          week: 5,
          day: "Tuesday",
          mode: "Walk",
          inbound: 12,
          outbound: 15,
          distance: 0.65
         }
      ],
      "Gerard" => [
        {
          week: 1,
          day: "Wednesday",
          mode: "Drive",
          inbound: 14,
          outbound: 12,
          distance: 5
        }
      ],
      }
```

And here is my implementation: 

```
def sort_by_name
  sorted_hash = Hash.new
  @input.each do |info_array|
      if sorted_hash.has_key?(info_array.first)
        sorted_hash[info_array.first] << {:week => info_array[1],
                              :day => info_array[2],
                              :mode => info_array[3],
                              :inbound => info_array[4],
                              :outbound => info_array[5],
                              :distance => info_array[6]}
      else
        sorted_hash[info_array.first] = [{:week => info_array[1],
                              :day => info_array[2],
                              :mode => info_array[3],
                              :inbound => info_array[4],
                              :outbound => info_array[5],
                              :distance => info_array[6]}]

      end
    end
  sorted_hash
end
```

Above, the instance variable @input is the array of arrays that comes in after parsing the CSV. We want to go through each
array, pick out the person's name and assign it to be the key of the sorted hash. When we dig into the rest of the array we can see 
that we want to make another hash (I will call it the information hash) and assign the headers to be the keys of the information hash. 
The values are the rest of the array. For example, the week is the second attribute of the info array, which has an index of 1. We continue
to iterate through the rest of the array, assigning headers to be keys, and array attributes to be values. 
The if statement says that if the key sorted hash already has the key, then shovel in the other information, but if it doesn't 
have the key, then we will make an array with the rest of the hash. That is all there is to it!

Further steps are to sort by week, and then by day of the week but that is a topic for another post. After that, it would be good to
expand so that you can have as many attributes as you want instead of knowing how many you have (in our case, 7). Maybe we'll get 
there next week. 
Enjoy!
