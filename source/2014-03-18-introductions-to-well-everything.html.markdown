In the theme of introductions, let me begin by introducing myself. I have never blogged, I have never done serious coding before
 the beginning of March, and I have never been good at writing. So please bear with me as I figure out this whole blog thing.
 I would like to chronicle my gSchool journey for any who might be interested to hear my story in regards to coding, and/or gSchool.
 Overall, the past two weeks have been fun and rewarding, though not without my fair share of frustration.

My previous life consisted of driving around a van for a mobile dental program and setting up a dental office inside
nursing homes in the Denver metro area to provide care for the residents. I would assist the dentist while they were doing
procedures, and for a while I thought about becoming a dentist. However, becoming a dentist takes a lot more time and money
than I was willing to risk to enter a market that is already basically saturated. Prior to that I studied chemical engineering
at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Though I really loved the tangibility of helping people who desperately needed dental care,
I was ready to come back to something more technical. I considered a lot of options that would take a lot of time and money, but
never really thought about working with computers. I thought that the people who were software engineers, and who worked with
computers for a profession were those who spent their free time when they were little kids taking apart and putting computers
back together. While some of them are, I have been convinced that you don't have to fit that stereotype to be a good developer.
I applied for gSchool at the beginning of December, and interviewed the week after my application was submitted. The holiday season was an emotional
roller coaster as I waited to hear back regarding my acceptance.

gSchool has been an incredible learning experience thus far (two weeks in), and I don't anticipate the pace letting up.
Learning has been fun like in a way that it never was in undergrad. For me, studying chemical engineering was 4 years of being
humbled. gSchool has been the most encouraging learning space I have ever had the privilege to be in. Everything is new,
but in an exciting sort of way. We keep talking about 'fire hoses' of information, and it really does feel like drinking from
a fire hose sometimes. Over the past two weeks, we have been introduced to git, Ruby, HTTP, some HTML, and test driven development
(TDD), among other things. I have more user names and logins than I have ever had. It seems like I have lots of knowledge-pieces
disjointed, but I am working on putting the pieces together slowly but surely.

In the spirit of technical blogging, here is the code that I am most proud of having written thus far:

And, it almost works like a real calculator. As you can see, I have a long journey ahead of me.
