title: Using Inject

I have been doing a lot of ruby lately, and my favorite way to learn ruby has been via exercism(found at exercism.io).
I like that they are on the shorter side of things, and that they really seem to get at the heart of problem solving.
It seems like recently, that programming at it's most basic level is storing things and learning how to get them back
out to manipulate. In this exercise that I will walk through, we want to count the number of words that appear in a given
phrase. We recently learned about the inject method, which I used in this exercise. The test looked like this:

```
class PhraseTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase

  def test_count_one_word
    phrase = Phrase.new("word")
    counts = {"word" => 1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_count_one_of_each
    phrase = Phrase.new("one of each")
    counts = {"one" => 1, "of" => 1, "each" => 1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_count_multiple_occurrences
    phrase = Phrase.new("one fish two fish red fish blue fish")
    counts = {"one" => 1, "fish" => 4, "two" => 1, "red" => 1, "blue" => 1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_count_everything_just_once
    phrase = Phrase.new("all the kings horses and all the kings men")
    phrase.word_count # count it an extra time
    counts = {
      "all" => 2, "the" => 2, "kings" => 2, "horses" => 1, "and" => 1, "men" => 1
    }
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_ignore_punctuation
    phrase = Phrase.new("car : carpet as java : javascript!!&@$%^&")
    counts = {"car" => 1, "carpet" => 1, "as" => 1, "java" => 1, "javascript" => 1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_handles_cramped_lists
    phrase = Phrase.new("one,two,three")
    counts = {"one" => 1, "two" => 1, "three" => 1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_include_numbers
    phrase = Phrase.new("testing, 1, 2 testing")
    counts = {"testing" => 2, "1" => 1, "2" => 1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_normalize_case
    phrase = Phrase.new("go Go GO")
    counts = {"go" => 3}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end

  def test_with_apostrophes
    phrase = Phrase.new("First: don't laugh. Then: don't cry.")
    counts = {"first"=>1, "don't"=>2, "laugh"=>1, "then"=>1, "cry"=>1}
    assert_equal counts, phrase.word_count
  end
end
```

The first test is simple to make pass, using a method called 'word-count', you simply initialize with the phrase, and
put the phrase into a hash where the key is the word and the value is one. The second test is similar, but instead you have
to split the phrase. Ruby's 'split' method will split on a space by default, so it is not necessary to split on a particular
character. The third test is where it got a little trickier. Now we have to do some real coding. Luckily, using the 'inject'
method, we only have a few lines of code compared with more required using the 'each' method. My code looked like this:

```
class Phrase
  def initialize(phrase)
    @phrase = phrase
  end

  def word_count
    split_phrase = @phrase.split
    split_phrase.inject(Hash.new(0)) do |accumulator, word|
      accumulator[word] += 1
      accumulator
    end
  end
end
```

I called my new hash 'accumulator' because it is what will hold all of the word-keys and the values. You have to set the initial
value to be zero so that you can begin to add to the count. Otherwise you will get an error that says: 'undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass'.
Not good. So now, we have the first four tests passing. The fifth one got pretty tricky, and after a while it became clear that I was going to
have to use a regular expression. I checked Rubular, and found that there is a RegEx for non-word characters, /\W/. So,
I used that and in the @phrase string subbed all of the non-word characters with a space. It was also at this point that
I made the split phrase it's own method. It was just getting too complicated. Of course, there was some capitalization
thrown in, so we had to downcase each word. The code is shown below:


```
class Phrase
  def initialize(phrase)
    @phrase = phrase
  end

  def word_count
    split_phrase.inject(Hash.new(0)) do |accumulator, word|
      accumulator[word.downcase] += 1
      accumulator
    end
  end

  def split_phrase
    @phrase.gsub(/\W/, " ").split
  end
end
```

This code got me to all but the last test, which stumped me for a bit. I finally decided to just make a regular expression
with all of the symbols that were found in the strings--essentially, everything but apostrophes. It seems like less of a
clean solution, but the result looks like this:

```
class Phrase
  def initialize(phrase)
    @phrase = phrase
  end

  def word_count
    split_phrase.inject(Hash.new(0)) do |accumulator, word|
      accumulator[word.downcase] += 1
      accumulator
    end
  end

  def split_phrase
    @phrase.gsub(/:|!|&|@|\$|%|\^|\.|,/, " ").split
  end
end
```

So there you have it: the highlights of a few hours of hard thinking.
